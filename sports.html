            <p>I've faced many challenges in life. During The Spartan Obstacle Course Race, I learnt how to peserverse and persist. I could complete all of the obstacles except one. The rope climbing obstacle always hinders my progress on the race, so in my last race, I used the scaffolding erected to help me reach the top. My preferred form of excersising is through cycling. Usually, every day I would cycling around 5 kilometres so that I can play the computer. To have proof to my father that I cycled 5 kilometres, I use strava to track my cycling(<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/51155064">This is my account, check it out!</a>) other than cycling, I also do rock climbing a lot, usually at climb central in Kallang Wave Mall. The first time I went, climbing to the top came naturally to me. I enjoy rock climbing, but as of January 2020, I sa climb central's automatic belaying system fail and I saw a boy fall off the wall. Lukily for him, the wall he was climbing was not very tall and he only sustained a few injuries.</p>
