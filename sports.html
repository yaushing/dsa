                        During The Spartan Obstacle Course Race, I learnt 
                        how to peserverse and persist. I could complete all
                        the obstacles except one. The rope climbing obstacle 
                        always hinders my progress on the race, 
                        so in my last race, I used the scaffolding 
                        erected to help me reach the top. My preferred
                        form of excersising is through 
                        cycling. Usually, every day I would cycle around
                        5 kilometres so that I can play the computer.</p>

                        <p class="para">To have proof to my father that I cycled 5
                        kilometres, I use strava to track my

                        (<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/51155064">This is my account, check it out!</a>)
                        Other than cycling, I also do rock climbing a 
                        lot, usually at Climb Central in 
                        Kallang Wave Mall. The first time I went, 
                        climbing to the top came naturally to me. I 
                        enjoy rock climbing, but as of January 2020, I saw 
                        Climb Central's automatic belaying system fail and a 
                        boy fall off the wall. Lukily for him, 
                        the wall he was climbing was not very tall
                        and he only sustained a few injuries.</p>
