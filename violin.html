            <p>I've been playing the violin since I moved to Singapore from Hong Kong, after I heard my sister and my father playing violin in Hong Kong the beautiful music enctised me to start learning. There where many times when I wanted to quit as it was hard, but my wonderful violin teacher helped me continue. My violin teacher is probably the best teacher anyone could have. <a href="achievements.html"> Click me to see my achievements in Violin</a></p>
