            <p>I've been playing the violin since I moved to Singapore from Hong Kong, after I heard my sister and my father playing violin in Hong Kong the beautiful music enctised me to start learning. There where many times when I wanted to quit as it was hard, but my wonderful violin teacher helped me continue. My violin teacher is probably the best teacher anyone could have. The one music artist that inspires me is Johanne Sebastian Bach. I think that he is the best song composer. He wrote my favorite songs including Sinfonia in D major BWV 789 and Prelude in C major BWV 846.</p><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2nbMCBBmKc3B6A30jYPmpD" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2EhOn1uBFUYLjpj5zZzDAA" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe><p>These songs were taken from spotify Â©</p>
